# Finding and Exploiting an Unused API Endpoint

##  Lab Title:
**Finding and exploiting an unused API endpoint**

##  Description:
This lab demonstrates how developers sometimes leave unused API endpoints exposed, and how an attacker can manipulate them to bypass business logic.


##  Exploitation Steps:

1. In Burp's browser, access the lab and click on a product.

2. In **Proxy > HTTP history**, find a request like: GET /api/products/1/price
3. Right-click the request → **Send to Repeater**

4. In **Repeater**, change the HTTP method from `GET` to `OPTIONS`  
→ Sends response listing allowed methods: `GET`, `PATCH`

5. Change method from `GET` to `PATCH` and send  
→ Response: `401 Unauthorized`

6. In Burp's browser, log in using: wiener:peter
7. Click on the **Lightweight "l33t" Leather Jacket** product.

8. In **Proxy > HTTP history**, find: /api/products/1/price
9. Send it to **Repeater**, change method from `GET` to `PATCH`  
→ Error: Missing/incorrect `Content-Type`

10. Add header: Content-Type: application/json
11. Add empty JSON body:  
```json
{}
```
- error: missing price parameter
- now add price to json body: {"price":0}
- send request and now reload the page
- price now shows $0.0
- now place order to solve the lab
