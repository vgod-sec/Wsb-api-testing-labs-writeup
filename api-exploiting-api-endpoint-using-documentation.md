# Exploiting an API endpoint using documentation

## ðŸ§  Lab Title:
**Exploiting an API endpoint using documentation**

## ðŸ“š Description:
This lab demonstrates how exposed or misconfigured API documentation can help attackers discover undocumented endpoints and perform malicious actions.

---

##  Exploitation Steps:

1. **Login to the application**  
   Use credentials: `wiener:peter`

2. **Capture the request**  
   In Burp Suite, go to **Proxy > HTTP history** and locate a `PATCH /api/user/wiener` request.  
   Right-click and **Send to Repeater**.

3. **Observe the response**  
   Send the request in Repeater and note the response showing user `wiener`'s credentials.

4. **Backtrack the endpoint**  
   - Modify the endpoint to `/api/user` â†’ returns error due to missing user ID.  
   - Then try `/api/` â†’ **retrieves API documentation**.

5. **Access interactive docs**  
   - Right-click response â†’ `Show response in browser`  
   - Copy and paste the URL in Burpâ€™s browser.  
   - The interactive Swagger UI opens.

6. **Delete Carlos using API Docs**  
   - In Swagger UI, locate the **DELETE** operation.  
   - Enter `carlos` as the username.  
   - Click `Execute` to delete the user.


##  Lab Solved:
Carlos's account was deleted by leveraging exposed API documentation.
